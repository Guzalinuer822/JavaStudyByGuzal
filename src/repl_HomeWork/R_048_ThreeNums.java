/*
in this problem you need to write a program that 
checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.

you get 3 int variables: n1 , n2 and n3

if n1 is biggest output: "n1 is bigger"
if n2 is biggest output: "n2 is bigger"
if n3 is biggest output: "n3 is bigger"


for example:

n1 = 1
n2  = 2
n3  = 1

output: "n2 is bigger"


n1 = 3
n2  = 2
n3  = 1

output: "n1 is bigger"

n1 = 3
n2  = 2
n3  = 30

output: "n3 is bigger"
